        <p>
         Most M&amp;A failures happen after the ink is dry because the &quot;product fit&quot; was
         never truly validated. We provide specialized buy-side and sell-side advisory
         that looks under the hood of the technology and the team. We assess
         technical scalability, product-market fit, and organizational synergy to ensure
         the integration creates 1+1=3 value.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>Why Choose Us?</strong> We go beyond the balance sheet. Our &quot;Product Due Diligence&quot;
         identifies hidden technical debt and IP risks that traditional auditors miss,
         giving you the leverage to negotiate with total confidence.
